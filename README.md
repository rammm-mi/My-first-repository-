And my favorite series are "Frieren: Beyond Journey's End"  
its a It's a popular Japanese manga series, The story follows an elf named Frieren who, after defeating a Demon King with her party, grapples with the concept of mortality and the passage of time. It's a poignant tale that explores themes of friendship, loss, and the human condition.
